i made this game all by my self, just to practice what i have learned in the past few weeks where i started learning python.
this is my 3th game after this i made the historical game "pong" and after a fancy version of "snake"
this game it obviusly incomplete and i had to adjust few things like the collision but i didn't have time to.
now im working on other things.
